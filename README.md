# Changing-YOLO-class-Id-from-.txt-file
Loops on YOLO format .txt file and can change the Class ID from any number to another and returning the exact .txt file with the changed class ID.

Think of labeling 10k images then you want to map it to COCO.names and your class id is 0 yet in COCO.names its 23. It is impossible to start labeling the images from the begining,
I present to you a code that will rename any class id from a number to the number you desire.
